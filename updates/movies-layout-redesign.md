# Movies Layout Redesign

## Changes Made

### Movies.tsx

- **Replaced tab interface** with a watched-focused layout
- **Made watched movies the primary view** by default
- **Added subtle "View Watchlist" button** in top-right corner instead of prominent tabs
- **Dynamic header titles** - "Your Movies" for watched, "Your Watchlist" for watchlist
- **Updated state management** from `activeTab` to simple `showWatchlist` boolean
- **Contextual descriptions** under each title explaining the view

### Visual Improvements

- **Larger movie cards** by changing MoviePoster size from 'md' to 'lg'
- **Reduced grid density** - fewer columns (2/3/4/6 instead of 2/4/6/8) for bigger cards
- **Maintained small gaps** (gap-1) between cards as requested
- **Clean toggle button** using secondary variant for subtle presence

### User Experience

- **Watched movies as primary focus** - users land here by default
- **Easy access to watchlist** via prominent but not overwhelming button
- **Clear context** with descriptive subtitles for each view
- **Streamlined navigation** without competing interface elements

### Layout Structure

- **Single view at a time** instead of side-by-side tabs
- **Primary/secondary relationship** between watched movies and watchlist
- **Consistent grid layout** but with bigger, more prominent movie cards
- **Preserved responsive behavior** across all screen sizes

## Files Changed

- `src/pages/Movies.tsx`

## Result

- **Watched movies take center stage** as the main feature
- **Larger, more prominent movie cards** with better visual impact
- **Cleaner interface** without competing navigation elements
- **Maintained all functionality** while improving focus and hierarchy
- **Better user flow** with clear primary and secondary actions
- **Responsive design** that works across all device sizes
