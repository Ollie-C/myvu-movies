# Profile Page as Dashboard Consolidation

## Changes Made

### App.tsx

- **Updated routing** to make Profile page serve as the main dashboard
- **Changed root route** from `Dashboard` to `Profile` component
- **Removed separate profile route** since it's now the home page
- **Removed Dashboard import** since it's no longer needed

### Sidebar.tsx

- **Updated profile icon functionality** to serve as the dashboard/home button
- **Changed link target** from `/profile` to `/` (root)
- **Updated label** from "Profile" to "Dashboard"
- **Updated active state logic** to highlight when on root path (`/`)

### Profile.tsx (Now Dashboard)

- **Updated page title** from "Profile" to "Dashboard"
- **Updated description** to "Welcome back! Here's your movie journey overview"
- **Maintained all existing functionality** including:
  - User profile section on the left
  - Recent movies, collections, and ranking statistics
  - Settings button access
  - All existing layout and styling

### Dashboard.tsx

- **Deleted old Dashboard.tsx** file since functionality is consolidated

## Design Rationale

- **Eliminated redundancy** - Profile and Dashboard were serving the same purpose
- **Streamlined navigation** - User profile info + overview in one place
- **Better user experience** - Landing page shows both personal info and activity overview
- **Cleaner architecture** - One less route and component to maintain

## Files Changed

- `src/App.tsx`
- `src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`
- `src/pages/Profile.tsx`
- `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` (deleted)

## Result

- **Unified dashboard experience** combining profile and overview functionality
- **Cleaner navigation** with profile icon serving as home button
- **Better landing experience** for users with immediate access to stats and info
- **Reduced codebase complexity** with consolidated functionality
- **Consistent with MVP goals** from roadmap focusing on core features
