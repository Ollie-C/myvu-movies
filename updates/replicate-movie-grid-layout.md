# Replicate Previous MovieGrid Layout System

## Changes Made

### Movies.tsx

- **Adopted the proven grid system** from the previous MovieGrid.tsx version
- **Responsive grid columns**: `grid-cols-5 sm:grid-cols-6 md:grid-cols-7 lg:grid-cols-9 xl:grid-cols-12`
- **Consistent gap-2** spacing between all cards
- **Aspect ratio handling** using `pb-[150%]` (150% padding-bottom) for proper movie poster proportions

### Key Improvements from Previous Version

- **No card squashing** - each breakpoint is carefully calculated to fit cards properly
- **Natural responsive behavior** - more columns added at larger screens without forcing cards to shrink
- **Consistent spacing** - gap-2 (8px) maintained at all viewport sizes
- **Proper aspect ratio** - 150% padding-bottom maintains movie poster proportions

### Grid Breakdown

- **Base (mobile)**: 5 columns - good density for small screens
- **sm (640px+)**: 6 columns - slight increase for larger phones
- **md (768px+)**: 7 columns - tablet portrait optimization
- **lg (1024px+)**: 9 columns - laptop/tablet landscape
- **xl (1280px+)**: 12 columns - desktop and larger screens

### Technical Implementation

- **Percentage-based aspect ratio** (`pb-[150%]`) ensures consistent movie poster proportions
- **Absolute positioning** of poster content within the aspect ratio container
- **Responsive without media queries** - CSS Grid handles the responsive behavior
- **Maintained compact poster size** for rating overlays and text content

## Files Changed

- `src/pages/Movies.tsx`

## Result

- **No more card squashing** at any viewport size
- **Optimal movie density** at each screen size
- **Consistent visual spacing** with gap-2 throughout
- **Proper movie poster aspect ratios** maintained
- **Better user experience** with predictable, responsive behavior
- **Proven layout system** from previous successful version
