Remember to:

- Add a file to the updates directory each time we make a change. In that file, please write a brief description, add the names that have been changed
- Keep the app clean and organised. Never over-engineer anything
- Let me know if a suggestion I make could possibly overcomplicate or break the app
- Remember that we are using bun and not npm
- Limit the use of icons in the design
- Do not get too far ahead of yourself. Only add what needs to be added. Anything extra - please suggest at the end of your response
